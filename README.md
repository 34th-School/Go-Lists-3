# Merge Sort

1. [+50%] Given the head of a singly linked list, sort it using the merge sort, and
   return the list after sorting it in ascending order. Implement the program
   in `merge_sort.go` and add tests in `merge_sort_test.go`.

2. [+50%] Write a recurrence equation for the merge sort. Prove that the merge
   sort complexity is $O(n \log n)$ by solving the equation.

3. [optional, +25%] We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows. In
   order to sort $A[1..n]$, we recursively sort $A[1..n-1]$ and then insert
   $A[n]$ into the sorted array $A[1..n-1]$.

   Write a recurrence equation for the insertion sort. Prove that the insertion
   sort complexity is $O(n^2)$ by solving the equation.
